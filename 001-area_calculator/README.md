# Circle Area Calculator

This Flutter application provides a simple tool to calculate the area of a circle based on user input of the circle's radius.

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to offer a convenient way to calculate the area of a circle, a common task in geometry and mathematics. Users can input the radius of a circle, and the application will instantly calculate and display the corresponding area.

## Formula Used

The area of a circle is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \]

Where:
- \(\pi\) (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.
- \(\text{radius}\) is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on its circumference.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application provides a clean and user-friendly interface with a text field for entering the radius and a button to initiate the calculation.

- **Real-time Calculation**: The area is calculated in real-time as soon as the user enters the radius, providing instant feedback.

- **Clear Display**: The calculated area is displayed prominently below the calculation button, ensuring clarity for the user.
